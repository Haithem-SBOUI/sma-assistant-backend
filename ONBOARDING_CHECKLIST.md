  ```

- [ ] Understand test structure and what's being tested

## üîß Day 3: Making Your First Changes

### Small Backend Change
- [ ] Add a new endpoint in `api/main.py`:
  ```python
  @app.get("/api/status")
  async def get_status():
      return {"status": "running", "developer": "Your Name"}
  ```

- [ ] Test the endpoint at `http://localhost:8000/api/status`

- [ ] Write a test for your new endpoint in `test_api.py`

### Small Frontend Change
- [ ] Modify the welcome message in `chat.component.html`
- [ ] Add your name or a personal touch to the interface
- [ ] Ensure the change appears in the browser

### Git Workflow Practice
- [ ] Create a new branch for your changes
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/onboarding-changes
  ```

- [ ] Commit your changes
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "feat: add personal touches for onboarding"
  ```

- [ ] Push the branch (don't merge yet - this is just practice)
  ```bash
  git push origin feature/onboarding-changes
  ```

## üß™ Day 4: Testing and Quality

### Understanding Testing
- [ ] Run individual test files:
  ```bash
  pytest test_schemas.py -v
  pytest test_api.py -v
